# Book Me Empressed


## Project 2: Rails App

#### Week 5

## Description

This is an app that is meant to connect clinets and Stylist.
As a hairstylist or any freelance job, building clientle is one of 
the most important things. 

This app is not to build clientele so much but to maintain the clients 
you have built.

It solves the problem of cancellations by allowing a client to reserve
an appoint with a stylist.

Right now this reservation process only sends a message to the stylist
that a particular client would like to book with them.

Later the aclient will be reserving that appointment with a credit
card deposit.

##  Technologies
