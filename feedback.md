#Project 2 Feedback

Congratulations on having completed project 2! I have provided you feedback in the form of a pullrequest, that you should not merge into your project. More detailed note of mine can be found throughout your projectâ€”run the command `rake notes` to see them.

## Rubric

### Criteria

* **Project WorkFlow**: Was the project planed thoroughly? Was it committed to frequently? Does it have a solid readme?
* **Technical Requirements**: Does the project meet the technical requirements in the project specs?
* **Creativity**: Is there a personal/creative touch in the project?
* **Code Quality**: Is the code well-named, DRY, commented, etc?
* **Problem Solving**: Was there an ability to break down a complex problem into smaller pieces and resourcefully solve each systematically?

### Possible Results

* Needs Improvement
* Complete
* Exceeded Expectations

## Evaluation

Areas for improvement:

* Give your readme a quick read-through for any silly spelling errors or trailing sentences.
* Try to match your commits messages with completed user stories. I.e. `user can login` or `user can favorite a stylist`.
* Do you have your user-stories or wireframes you used during planning? If so can you link to them or embed them in your readme?
* The user experience is a bit jarring between between the video that automatically plays and cannot be paused & the moving contact form.
* Often for a website less is more. Consider weeding out anything on your site that isn't being used. I think it will make a big difference!

Keep doing:

* Readme has the correct outline.
* Nice job committing relatively frequently.
* High level of creativity: I'm happy you experimented with the `<video>` tag and tried your hand at animations (the expanding and collapsing buttons are ridiculous/hilarious).
* Overall this is a solid project. Among other things, you tackled auth, a many to many relationship, and CRUDing data via RESTful routes. Nice!

### Result: Complete
